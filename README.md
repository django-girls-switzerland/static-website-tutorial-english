# Django Girls Zurich Extended Workshop


## A. Preparation

Please prepare for the workshop by installing Python, Git and Atom on your laptop and open a GitHub account. The [preparation chapter](./preparations.md) will explain you how to do this. Additionally, we ask you to read read the chapter ["How the internet works"](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/how_the_internet_works/) from the Django Girls Tutorial.


## B. The Workshop
During the workshop we'll go through the following topics.

### 1. Command Line (Saturday morning, first thing)

The following two days we'll work a lot with the command line. Follow the chapter ["Introduction to the command-line interface"](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/intro_to_command_line/) to learn what it is and how to use it.

### 2. Your First Static Website (Saturday morning)

Now we'll be making a [static website and publish it on GitHub](./static-website/README.md).

### 3. Introduction to Python (Saturday afternoon)

This is where things get nerdy \(but don't worry, your coach is there to help\). We let our static website rest for the time being and follow the chapter ["Introduction to Python"](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/python_introduction/) of the official Django Girls Tutorial. We will need Python to overcome the challenge for Sunday: making a dynamic website.

### 4. Django: Your Blog is a Dynamic Website (Sunday, all day)

Now it is time to really get into the Django Girls tutorial. We start with the chapter ["What is Django?"](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/django/) and work through the following chapters during the day.
Your Django blog independent of your static website at first (we can make them work together later), so you will have to start from a new folder. Also in GitHub we will store it separately from your previous code. Because GitHub can only serve static websites all by itself, we will have to publish \(also called deploy in programmer slang\) our website using yet another internet service called Pythonanywhere. We will still use GitHub to store our code, but this time it is only an intermediate step and we will have to use Pythonanywhere to actually display our site. This sounds complicated, and it is. Once you have managed to get your dynamic site online, that is a big achievement. But no worries, everything is explained in detail in the Django Girls Tutorial and we will help you to get there.

## C. Extras

Depending on your time and interest, you can work on those topics during the workshop, at home, or during one of the follow-up events:

* [Integrating your static website into your Django project](./extras/adding-your-static-page-to-django.md)
* Using the [Django Girls tutorial extensions](https://djangogirls.gitbooks.io/django-girls-tutorial-extensions/content/en/) to improve your blog.
